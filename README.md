# Documentation: Job Role Recommendation System

## Objective

This project aims to create a simple recommendation engine that, given a Data Science or Machine Learning job role, recommends the three closest roles based on the similarity of required skills. The solution uses **cosine similarity** to measure the similarity between roles based on shared skills.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of job roles and their required skills, as shown below:


| Role | Skills |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Data Scientist** | Python, Statistics, Machine Learning, Data Visualization |
| **ML Engineer** | Python, Machine Learning, Deployment, Algorithms |
| **Data Analyst** | SQL, Python, Data Visualization, Excel |
| **Data Engineer** | Python, SQL, ETL, Cloud Computing |
| **AI Researcher** | Python, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Algorithms |
| **Business Analyst** | Excel, SQL, Data Visualization, Business Intelligence |
| **NLP Engineer** | Python, NLP, Machine Learning, Deep Learning |

## Methodology

### Approach

The recommendation engine uses **cosine similarity**, a popular technique for measuring the similarity between two vectors. In this case:

- Each job role's skills are converted into a binary vector representation (e.g., `1` for presence of a skill and `0` for absence).
- Cosine similarity measures the angle between these vectors to determine how similar two roles are based on their skill sets.


### Steps

1. **Data Preparation**:
    - Convert each job role's skills into a text format (e.g., "Python Statistics Machine Learning").
    - Use `CountVectorizer` to create binary feature vectors for each role.
2. **Similarity Calculation**:
    - Compute pairwise cosine similarity between all job roles using `cosine_similarity` from scikit-learn.
3. **Recommendation Generation**:
    - For a given input role:
        - Find the three most similar roles based on cosine similarity scores.
        - Display shared skills and similarity scores for interpretability.

## Why Cosine Similarity?

Cosine similarity was chosen because:

1. **Simplicity**: It is straightforward to implement and computationally efficient.
2. **Effectiveness**: It works well for comparing text-based features like skills.
3. **Interpretability**: The similarity score (range: 0 to 1) provides an intuitive measure of closeness between roles.

## Code Explanation

### Key Functions

#### 1. `get_recommendations(role_name)`

This function takes an input job role and returns the top 3 recommended roles based on cosine similarity.

- **Inputs**:
    - `role_name`: Name of the input job role.
- **Outputs**:
    - A list of dictionaries containing:
        - Recommended role name
        - Similarity score
        - Skills required for the recommended role
        - Shared skills with the input role


#### 2. Streamlit Interface

The Streamlit app provides an interactive interface where users can:

- View available job roles and their required skills.
- Select a job role from a dropdown menu.
- Get recommendations with detailed explanations (similarity score and shared skills).

## How to Run the Application

### Prerequisites

1. Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn streamlit
```

2. Save the code in a file (e.g., `app.py`).

### Running the App

1. Run the Streamlit application:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

2. Open the local URL provided by Streamlit (e.g., http://localhost:8501).

## Example Usage

### Input Role: "Data Scientist"

#### Output Recommendations:

1. **ML Engineer**
    - Similarity Score: `0.67`
    - Skills: Python, Machine Learning, Deployment, Algorithms
    - Shared Skills: Python, Machine Learning
2. **AI Researcher**
    - Similarity Score: `0.67`
    - Skills: Python, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Algorithms
    - Shared Skills: Python, Machine Learning
3. **Data Analyst**
    - Similarity Score: `0.50`
    - Skills: SQL, Python, Data Visualization, Excel
    - Shared Skills: Python, Data Visualization

## Evaluation Criteria

1. **Correctness**:
The engine accurately identifies similar roles based on shared skills.
2. **Simplicity \& Clarity**:
The code is clean and easy to understand.
3. **Interpretability**:
The recommendations include shared skills and similarity scores for transparency.

## Conclusion

This recommendation system is simple yet effective for identifying similar job roles based on required skills using cosine similarity. It provides clear recommendations with interpretability and can be easily extended to larger datasets or additional features like weighting specific skills or incorporating user preferences.
